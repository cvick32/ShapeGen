# ShapeGen
Racket interactive programs for making fun shapes.

BlackBackground (IN PROGRESS): Will eventually render moving colored circleson a black background 

Lab12: Creates animated circles wherever the mouse moves. Circles are random sizes and colors. 

Lab12AnimatedStack: Very trippy random mix of changing shapes stacked on top of each other, getting smaller and smaller
with more mouse clicks.

Lab12InlaidCircles (IN PROGRESS): Should have inlaid circles getting smaller and smaller. Right now it has randomly
alternating black and white squares that get smaller the more you click. 

Lab12RandomVariant: Creates circles of random size and color that move all over the screen.

Lab12Star: 'Simulates' the night sky with stars that move.

Lab12SquareAndCircle: Trippy, hypnotic stack of random squares and circles that get smaller.
